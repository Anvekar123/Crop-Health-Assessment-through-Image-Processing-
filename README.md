# Crop-Health-Assessment-through-Image-Processing
## Overview
This project addresses the challenges of traditional crop health monitoring methods by implementing a real-time, automated system for assessing crop health. Leveraging machine learning and image processing techniques, it aims to detect diseases and nutrient deficiencies in crops accurately and efficiently, enabling timely interventions and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

## Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously tracks crop health through live image analysis.

Disease Detection: Identifies specific crop diseases and nutrient deficiencies using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

Optimization Techniques: Enhances model performance with regularization, learning rate schedulers, and increased filter sizes.

Scalability: Designed to generalize across various crop types and environmental conditions.

## System Components
### Hardware
Camera: High-resolution RGB camera for capturing crop images.

Computing Device: Desktop or laptop for running the CNN model and processing images.

### Software
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the CNN model.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For visualizing training and validation results.

Python: For developing the pipeline and integration.

## Workflow
Dataset Preparation: Collect crop images categorized into healthy and diseased labels. Apply offline augmentation to improve model robustness.

Model Training: Train a CNN model with features like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, and Dropout layers. Use learning rate schedulers and regularization techniques for optimization.

Prediction: Test the trained model on unseen data to assess its generalizability and accuracy.

Visualization: Plot training and validation accuracy. Display test predictions with corresponding crop health status.
